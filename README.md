### Planto.AI Vs Code Extension (using Langchain) 
planto.extension
this file contains original files created by - Milan Roat for a vs-code extension (by command name - 'Get Suggestion')
API Key used - GROQ API (the API key in extension.ts is empty for now . use your own key to get results) Model used - llama3-8b-8192
the main logic code for a this copilot to help/give suggestion of selected text is in extension.ts file.
#### to use this extension - Download Planto.ZIP file, follow the steps, save and compile all files -> press f5 now the window opened will have the extension loaded .
Features - 
->open any code file in any language
->select some code lines which you want to get results
->use 'Get Suggesion' command from extensions window . (i.e. press ctrl+shift+P)
->the results will be added to the code file.
the added screenshots below are while using this copilot for a selected code 


### Retail Multi-Agent AI System using LangGraph & LLMs
A modular, multi-agentic AI system designed to optimize demand forecasting, inventory planning, dynamic pricing, and supply chain management in retail ‚Äî built with LangGraph and enhanced with traditional ML + LLM reasoning.
[CustomerAgent]
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Forecasts demand using past data + business features
[InventoryAgent]
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Evaluates whether current stock meets forecasted demand
[PricingAgent]
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Suggests updated prices based on inventory + customer segments
[SupplyChainAgent]
    ‚¨áÔ∏è Final fulfillment strategy with recommendations per product-store pair
 LangGraph makes it simple to insert LLM-powered reasoning, fallback logic, or natural language prompts mid-pipeline.

üß© How LLMs Could Enhance This
Use LLMs to interpret textual business data (e.g., market reports, vendor updates).
Generate rationale for pricing changes or forecast anomalies.
Understand unstructured vendor constraints (e.g., delays via email).
LangGraph enables seamless mixing of traditional ML + generative AI reasoning.

üìà Final Outcome
An end-to-end system that delivers actionable insights like:
"Product 1000 in Region X is expected to spike during the upcoming holiday. Current inventory is under threshold. Increase price by 10% for premium customers and restock 200 units within 3 days.

## 1] FINE_tuning_llama_model:
this project is focused on fine tuning llama 2 model 
based on a custom dataset
original dataset link - https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fdatasets%2Ftimdettmers%2Fopenassistant-guanaco
this data set is reformed and out of 10k rows , only 1k rows are taken due to memory resource constraint
reformatted dataset based on llama template - https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlabonne/guanaco-llama2-1k

### to run this code , the system needs to be connected to a GPU


## 2] BioMistral Medical Query Generator
This project demonstrates the use of a quantized version of the BioMistral-7B model to generate responses for medical queries. The application provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for interacting with the model, enabling the exploration of medical text generation. The model is fine-tuned for medical applications, ensuring precise and reliable responses.

### Key Features
Medical Text Generation: Generates contextually accurate medical responses using the BioMistral-7B model.
Streamlit Integration: A responsive interface for querying the model.
Quantized Model Deployment: Utilizes a  quantized version of BioMistral-7B for efficient performance

Libraries and Tools
llama-cpp-python: To run the quantized BioMistral model locally.
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web interface.
